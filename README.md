## Project Goal
Foodadvisor is a web application designed to simplify the process of discovering food-related content, such as blog posts, based on the userâ€™s specific preferences. By allowing users to select their favorite food categories, it ensures personalized recommendations, thus enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

The application addresses the challenge of information overload, particularly in the food industry where users often struggle to find relevant, high-quality content that fits their tastes. By offering a tailored approach, Foodadvisor solves the problem of inefficient food content discovery and creates an opportunity for food bloggers, restaurants, and food enthusiasts to connect in a more meaningful, user-centric way. This results in a better browsing experience, helping users find food inspiration more quickly and easily.

### Features
- **Feature 1**: user is able to choose food categories and location
- **Feature 2**: the application shows relevant blog post according to the user's chosen food categories
- **Feature 3**: the application have a subscription service
- **Feature 4**: the application can show blog post that user choose
- **Feature 5**: the application use CRUD service through Strapi API
### Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Strapi V4
- **Frontend:** NextJS + Tailwind
- **Hosting/Deployment:** AWS EC2
- **Database:** SQLite
## How to deploy and run the project manually
### Prerequisites

- **AWS EC2 Instance**: Launch an Amazon Linux instance.
- **Security Group Settings**:
  - Allow inbound traffic on ports `3000` and `1337` from your public IP address.
- **SSH Access**: Ensure you can connect to your EC2 instance via SSH.

### Steps

#### 1. Update the System

Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH and run:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

#### 2. Install Node.js using Fast Node Manager (fnm)

Install `fnm`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
```

Activate `fnm`:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install Node.js version 16:

```bash
fnm use --install-if-missing 16
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
node -v  # Should output v16.20.2
npm -v   # Should output 8.19.4
```

#### 3. Install Git

```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

#### 4. Install Yarn

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

#### 5. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kanchanop6509650229/CS360-QWERTYUIOP.git
```

#### 6. Set Up the API

Navigate to the API directory:

```bash
cd CS360-QWERTYUIOP/api
```

Install dependencies, seed the database, and start the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn seed && yarn develop
```

#### 7. Configure Environment Variables for the API

Create or edit the `.env` file:

```bash
nano .env
```

Add the following configurations:

```env
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=Your_Admin_JWT_Secret
JWT_SECRET=Your_JWT_Secret
STRAPI_ADMIN_CLIENT_URL=http://Your_Public_IP:3000
STRAPI_ADMIN_CLIENT_PREVIEW_SECRET=Your_Preview_Secret
```

- Replace `Your_Admin_JWT_Secret` and `Your_JWT_Secret` with secure, randomly generated strings.
- Replace `Your_Public_IP` with your EC2 instance's public IP address.
- Replace `Your_Preview_Secret` with another secure, randomly generated string.

#### 8. Access the Strapi Admin Panel

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://Your_Public_IP:1337/admin
```
##### Credentials
###### Super Admin:
- **Email**: `admin@strapidemo.com`
- **Password**: `welcomeToStrapi123`

###### Editor:
- **Email**: `editor@strapidemo.com`
- **Password**: `welcomeToStrapi123`

###### Author:
- **Email**: `author@strapidemo.com`
- **Password**: `welcomeToStrapi123


#### 9. Set Up the Client

Open a new SSH session to your EC2 instance (keep the previous one running).

Navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd CS360-QWERTYUIOP/client
```

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

#### 10. Configure Environment Variables for the Client

Edit the `.env.development` file:

```bash
nano .env.development
```

Add the following configurations:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://Your_Public_IP:1337
PREVIEW_SECRET=Your_Preview_Secret
```

- Ensure `Your_Public_IP` matches the one used earlier.
- Use the same `Your_Preview_Secret` as set in the API configuration.

#### 11. Install PM2 Process Manager

Navigate back to your home directory:

```bash
cd ~
```

Install PM2 globally:

```bash
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Initialize PM2:

```bash
pm2 init
```

#### 12. Configure PM2

Edit the `ecosystem.config.js` file:

```bash
nano ecosystem.config.js
```

Modify the file with the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'api',
      cwd: '/home/ec2-user/CS360-QWERTYUIOP/api',
      script: 'yarn',
      args: 'develop',
      env: {
        ADMIN_JWT_SECRET: 'Your_Admin_JWT_Secret',
        JWT_SECRET: 'Your_JWT_Secret',
        STRAPI_ADMIN_CLIENT_URL: 'http://Your_Public_IP:3000',
        STRAPI_ADMIN_CLIENT_PREVIEW_SECRET: 'Your_Preview_Secret',
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'client',
      cwd: '/home/ec2-user/CS360-QWERTYUIOP/client',
      script: 'yarn',
      args: 'dev',
      env: {
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: 'http://Your_Public_IP:1337',
        PREVIEW_SECRET: 'Your_Preview_Secret',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

- Ensure the `cwd` paths point to the correct directories.
- Replace all placeholders with the same values as before.

#### 13. Start the Applications with PM2

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

#### 14. Verify the Applications are Running

Check the status of your applications:

```bash
pm2 status
```

#### 15. Access the Client Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://Your_Public_IP:3000
```
